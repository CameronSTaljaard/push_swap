### What is push_swap?
Push_swap is the first task given in the algorithms branch.
In this project, we are asked to sort a stack of integers, with a very limited toolset.

We can perform 1 of 11 actions. These are the only actions you are allowed to use for sorting your stack.
1. pa - Pushes the int at the top of stack b, to the top of stack b.
2. pb - Pushes the int at the top of stack a, to the top of stack a.
3. sa - Swap the top two elements of a.
4. sb - Swap the top two elements of b.
5. ss - Swap the top two elements of a and b.
6. ra - Rotates stack a.
7. rb - Rotates stack b.
8. rr - Rotate stack a and b.
9. rra - Reverse rotates a.
10. rrb - Reverse rotates b.
11. rrr - Reverse rotates a and b.

In this project, we are graded based on the efficiency of our sorting algorithm, and awarded bonus point for visualizing the stacks a, and b.
